 * property and return the result of the function.
 *
 * This is kind of hard to explain, so let's compare it with `resource` and use a proper example:
 * - `resource`: (name, key, fn) => ({ [key]: fn, [name]: true })
 * - `resourceCreator`: ((name, key, creatorFn) => creatorFn(...) => fn)[key]: creatorFn()
 *
 * While `resource` is meant to create objects with a resource function, this is meant to create
 * those resource functions by sending them "optional paramters", and they are optionals because
 * if you access the `key` property, it would be the same as calling the `creatorFn` without
 * paramters.
 * @param {string}   name      The name of the resource, to be added as a property of both the

 *                             used without parameters; and also the key in which the result
